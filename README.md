Full Stack - Teams Feature &amp; Back End - Jobs Refactoring

Fairly HR is a job advert board Startup company that aims to connect employers and potential employees together through value-based matching for job search and job posting.

In my time with Fairly HR, I was responsible for creating the Teams features which would enable an company to create team departments within their company page on the website. 

Additionally, I was tasked with the responsibility of refactoring the backend for the jobs features. Specifically, I had to consolidate different job models in .NET as well as updating the service, interface, and API controller files to match the refactored models.
